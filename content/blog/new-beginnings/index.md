React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source,

front end, JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces

or UI components.


It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual

developers and companies.



React can be used as a base in the development of single-page

or mobile applications.



React usually requires the use of additional libraries for state

management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective

examples of such libraries.
