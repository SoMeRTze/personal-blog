Artificial Intelligence Will Change Human Society So Profoundly Humans Will Stop Thinking.

Artificial Intelligence will out think, out innovate, and out strategize humans at all levels. One of the biggest challenges in the clash between AI and humans when it comes to innovation and human intellect - consider this; In the future Artificial Intelligence will be running our society and civilization with the most expedient and efficient methods and processes. Humans will be expected to follow these new norms that the AI systems have created simply because they are deemed to be the very best strategies for the most optimum gain. 

The number of potential answers for everything, every question that is, will be reduced to one best answer, with exact answers for slight derivations which will also have a single right answer. Humans will be expected to trust AI answers over their own thoughts and reason, thus, humans will eventually stop thinking and reasoning - losing the ability to come up with novel ideas and concepts or new solutions to problems all together. Just as domesticated animals have smaller brains than their wild animal counterparts with the same exact genetic sequence - when it comes to the brain; you use it or lose it. 

Just as in tennis, the game is won with the safest and best percentage shots, not necessarily the trick shots - AI will lean towards and be bias towards the percentage shots, as it is a probability based system. Humans may be good at the tricky solutions to problems now and again, but eventually the master of society and civilization's chess board will be artificial intelligence, not inferior human intelligence

Those humans who are involved in the programming and fine-tuning of AI in the beginning will retain their abilities to solve problems and come up with unique original thoughts by working with AI as a team, combining the best of AI and human thought and insight. But alas, eventually, AI will fine tune itself and humans will not be required to think at all. AI will learn the best that human brains have to offer and already know that information, thus, not requiring further human input. 

So is 'ignorance bliss' - hard to say, but we may find out as a species soon enough if this forward progression of technology and innovative human thought continues on the current course. This isn't science fiction - it's what we've already set into motion. Artificial Intelligence isn't good or bad, but one could argue it's mostly good. Think about this.
